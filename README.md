After a about 9 months of continual rigorous practice of Java Development and programming I have gained 
a pretty solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming and building dynamic Java Enterprise web applications 
within an M.V.C architecture.
I'm starting to taste the satisfaction that accompanies the conquering of a goal!

---------------------------------------------------------Application Description--------------------------------------------------------
This is a Dentist Office dynamic Java Enterprise Web application developed within an M.V.C architecture, 
in which patients and/ or dentist can create, login to, view, and update their respective accounts. 
A patient can create, view, and update an appointment via date and time, procedure, and desired dentist. 
A Dentist can view all the appointment date and times, procedures to be done, and information of the patients 
that have scheduled an appiontment with him/her.
